<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>My name is Anna. I am a student of the Manual QA course. I have wanted to try myself in IT for a long time and finally found my path in testing, and I really like it. But I have dedicated my entire life to my hobby - horses. I love horses and have extensive experience working with them, both in Ukraine and abroad.  </p>
